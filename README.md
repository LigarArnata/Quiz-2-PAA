# Quiz-2-PAA

This repository will contain the code that will implement how to search a shortest path from starting point to an end point with A* Algorithm. The code is in file named "Shortest Path A*" in this repository. The Analysis about how the code work and implemented will be explained in the "Code Explanation and Analysis File". The Design of this code is very simple, it will use the terminal, and some of character to describe the starting point, end point, and the shortest path. Here's the of the design of the program
